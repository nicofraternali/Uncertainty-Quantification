    "## The Frequency Response Function (FRF)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing a dynamic system—like a vibrating beam or a car suspension—you apply an input (e.g., a force) and measure the output (e.g., displacement or acceleration). The **Frequency Response Function (FRF)** is your key to understanding how the system behaves across different frequencies. It acts like a \"frequency-domain fingerprint,\" showing how the system amplifies, dampens, or shifts inputs based on their frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the FRF, we first need to dive into the **Fourier Transform**, which connects the time domain to the frequency domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Fourier Transform: Time to Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What It Does\n",
    "The **Fourier Transform** takes a time-domain signal—like a vibration recorded over time—and breaks it into its individual frequency components. Imagine a prism splitting white light into a rainbow of colors; here, the Fourier Transform separates a complex signal into pure tones (sine waves).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Domain**: The signal is a messy mix of waves, like a chord where you hear the combined sound but not the individual notes.\n",
    "- **Frequency Domain**: The Fourier Transform reveals the \"notes\"—the frequencies present, their strengths (amplitude), and their timing (phase).\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s essentially the \"recipe\" of frequencies that build the original signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Definition\n",
    "The Fourier Transform of a continuous-time signal $x(t)$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t) e^{-j \\omega t} \\, dt$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $X(\\omega)$: The frequency-domain representation of $x(t)$.\n",
    "- $\\omega$: Angular frequency (radians per second).\n",
    "- $j$: The imaginary unit ($j^2 = -1$).\n",
    "- $e^{-j \\omega t}$: A complex exponential representing sine and cosine waves via Euler’s formula: $e^{-j \\omega t} = \\cos(\\omega t) - j \\sin(\\omega t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This integral measures how much of each frequency $\\omega$ contributes to $x(t)$ by correlating the signal with these complex exponentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quick Derivation Intuition\n",
    "Why does the Fourier Transform work? Here’s a simplified intuition:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basis Functions**: Any signal can be built from sine and cosine waves of different frequencies, which act like a complete set of building blocks (similar to basis vectors in linear algebra).\n",
    "2. **Projection**: The Fourier Transform \"projects\" the signal onto each frequency’s sine and cosine waves, calculating how much of each frequency is present. The integral $\\int x(t) e^{-j \\omega t} \\, dt$ does this projection.\n",
    "3. **Complex Exponentials**: Using $e^{-j \\omega t}$ combines sine and cosine into one term (thanks to Euler’s formula), making the math elegant and compact.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result, $X(\\omega)$, tells you the amplitude and phase of each frequency component in the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why It’s Useful\n",
    "The Fourier Transform shifts your view from time to frequency, enabling you to:\n",
    "- Spot dominant frequencies (e.g., a machine’s resonance).\n",
    "- Filter noise (e.g., a 60 Hz hum in audio).\n",
    "- Analyze system behavior, which ties directly into the FRF.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Is the FRF?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Frequency Response Function (FRF)**, denoted $H(\\omega)$, is the ratio of the system’s output to its input in the frequency domain:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H(\\omega) = \\frac{Y(\\omega)}{X(\\omega)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $X(\\omega)$: Fourier Transform of the input signal $x(t)$ (e.g., applied force).\n",
    "- $Y(\\omega)$: Fourier Transform of the output signal $y(t)$ (e.g., displacement).\n",
    "- $\\omega$: Frequency in radians per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FRF reveals:\n",
    "- **Magnitude $|H(\\omega)|$**: How much the input is amplified or reduced.\n",
    "- **Phase $\\angle H(\\omega)$**: The time shift between input and output.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connecting FRF to the Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "For a linear system, the output $y(t)$ is the input $x(t)$ convolved with the system’s **impulse response** $h(t)$ (the output from a short \"impulse\" input):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y(t) = h(t) * x(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(\\tau) x(t - \\tau) \\, d\\tau$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution is complex in the time domain, but the Fourier Transform simplifies it. In the frequency domain, convolution becomes multiplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y(\\omega) = H(\\omega) \\cdot X(\\omega)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the key: the FRF $H(\\omega)$ is the Fourier Transform of the impulse response $h(t)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{h(t)\\} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(t) e^{-j \\omega t} \\, dt$$\n",

    "### Example: Mass-Spring-Damper System\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a mass $m$, spring stiffness $k$, and damper $c$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m \\ddot{d} + c \\dot{d} + k d = f(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $f(t)$: Input force.\n",
    "- $d(t)$: Displacement (output).\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the Fourier Transform (with zero initial conditions):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(-m \\omega^2 + j c \\omega + k) D(\\omega) = F(\\omega)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The FRF for displacement is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H(\\omega) = \\frac{D(\\omega)}{F(\\omega)} = \\frac{1}{k - m \\omega^2 + j c \\omega}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Magnitude $|H(\\omega)|$**: Peaks at the **natural frequency** $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{k/m}$, where resonance occurs.\n",
    "- **Damping $c$**: Higher $c$ lowers and flattens the peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting $|H(\\omega)|$ versus $\\omega$ shows a resonance peak at $\\omega_n$, shaped by damping.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Intuitions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resonance**: Peaks in $|H(\\omega)|$ indicate frequencies where the system naturally vibrates strongly.\n",
    "2. **Linearity**: The FRF assumes a **linear time-invariant (LTI)** system. Nonlinear systems require different methods.\n",
    "3. **Practical Measurement**: Engineers estimate $|H(\\omega)|$ by applying a known input (e.g., a hammer tap) and measuring the output, then computing $\\frac{Y(\\omega)}{X(\\omega)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "The FRF is vital in fields like structural dynamics:\n",
    "- **Design**: Avoid resonance in bridges or engines.\n",
    "- **Diagnostics**: Detect damage from shifts in resonance.\n",
    "- **Control**: Design vibration isolators.\n",
