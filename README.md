# Uncertainty-Quantification

This series of Jupyter Notebooks is based on the short book named **QUANTIFICAÇÃO DE INCERTEZA E ESTIMAÇÃO DE PARÂMETROS EM DINÂMICA ESTRUTURAL: UMA INTRODUÇÃO BASEADA EM EXEMPLOS COMPUTACIONAIS** by <u>Daniel Alves Castello</u> and <u>Thiago Gamboa Ritto</u>.

I aim to summarize the contents of their work, go through the theory, the formulae and it's derivation. 

Finally, the main purpose of this endeavour: translate the provided MATLAB codes to Python programming language.

We introduce some Probability Theory fundamentals then tackle a static problem were we determine the stiffness of our model based on experimental data
